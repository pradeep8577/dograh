The fastest way to build voice bots - get started with any voice AI use case in under 2 minutes (our hard SLA standards).
Build voice agents in just one line or drag-and-drop, then test them using AI personas that mimic real customer calls. It's 100% open source, self-hosted if you want, and never hides a line of code- ever. The project has a strong commitment to **100% open source** and every line of code is released in the open.
Maintained by YC alumni and exit founders, we're making sure the future of voice AI stays open, not monopolized.

## 🚀 Get Started

The only command you need to run:

```bash
# Download and start Dograh
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && docker compose up
```

> **Note**  
> First startup may take 2-3 minutes to download all images. Once running, open http://localhost:3000 to create your first AI voice assistant!  
> For prerequisites, port issues, or troubleshooting, see the [Prerequisites and Troubleshooting](#-prerequisites-and-troubleshooting) section below.
 
### 🎙️ Your First Voice Bot

1. **Open Dashboard**: Launch [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your browser
2. **Choose Call Type**: Select **Inbound** or **Outbound** calling.
3. **Name Your Bot**: Use a short two-word name (e.g., *Lead Qualification*).
4. **Describe Use Case**: In 5–10 words (e.g., *Screen insurance form submissions for purchase intent*).
5. **Launch**: Your bot is ready! Open the bot and click **Web Call** to talk to it.
6. **No API Keys Needed**: We auto-generate Dograh API keys so you can start immediately. You can switch to your own keys anytime.
7. **Default Access**: Includes Dograh’s own LLMs, STT, and TTS stack by default.
8. **Bring Your Own Keys**: Optionally connect your own API keys for LLMs, STT, TTS, or telephony providers like Twilio.

## 🔧 Prerequisites and Troubleshooting

### Prerequisites

To run Dograh AI locally, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (version 20.10 or later)
- [curl](https://curl.se/download.html) – usually preinstalled on macOS/Linux

> **Note**  
> Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop. Make sure Docker is running before you begin.

### Required Ports

Ensure these ports are available:
- `3000` - Web UI
- `8000` - API Server
- `5432` - PostgreSQL
- `6379` - Redis
- `9000` - MinIO (S3-compatible storage)
- `9001` - MinIO Console

### Checking Port Availability

```bash
# Check if a port is in use (replace 3000 with the port number)
lsof -i :3000
```

### Freeing Up Ports

#### When a port is already in use:
```bash
# Check what's using the port first
lsof -i :3000

# Then kill the process (may require sudo on Linux)
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i :3000)
```

#### When Docker containers are using the ports (with auto-restart enabled):

**Step 1:** Stop all running containers
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

**Step 2:** Disable restart policy for all containers
This prevents containers from automatically restarting:
```bash
docker update --restart=no $(docker ps -a -q)
```

**Step 3:** Verify

Check that no containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

Check restart policies (should show 'no' for each container):
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{.Name}} - {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name}}' $(docker ps -a -q)
```

### Stopping Dograh Services

```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Stop and remove all data (full cleanup)
docker compose down -v
```

## Configuration
Dograh automatically generates API keys on first run, but you can use your own keys. 
  - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_sid_here
  - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here
