### Langfuse
We provide seamless integration with [Langfuse](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse) so that you can enable tracing when you self host Dograh. In order to do that, you can sign up on [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) and create API credentials for you. Once you have your API tokens, you can put those in the environment variables. (If you are using docker, you can put that in `api` service of `docker-compose.yaml`). 

```
ENABLE_TRACING="true"
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=
LANGFUSE_HOST=
```

Once you enable this, you would be able to see traces whenever a run completes in Dograh.
