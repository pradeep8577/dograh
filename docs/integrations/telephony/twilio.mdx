## Overview

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that enables voice calling, messaging, and video capabilities. Dograh AI's Twilio integration provides seamless connectivity for your voice agents.

## Prerequisites

- A [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
- Account SID and Auth Token from your Twilio Console
- At least one Twilio phone number
- Dograh AI instance running and accessible

## Configuration

### Step 1: Get Twilio Credentials

1. Log in to your [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/)
2. Find your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** on the dashboard
3. Navigate to **Phone Numbers** → **Manage** → **Active Numbers**
4. Copy your phone number(s)

### Step 2: Configure in Dograh AI

1. Navigate to **Workflow** → **Phone Call** → **Configure Telephony**
2. Watch the Twilio setup video tutorial above for detailed guidance
3. Select **Twilio** as your provider
4. Enter your credentials:
   - Account SID
   - Auth Token
   - From Phone Number (with country code, e.g., +1234567890)
5. Click **Save Configuration**

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration

1. Create a test workflow
2. Click "Test Call" to verify connection
3. Check call logs for successful connection

## How It Works

### Outbound Calling
When you initiate a call through Dograh AI:
1. The system selects a phone number from your configured pool
2. Twilio places the call to your recipient
3. Once connected, audio streams through WebSocket for real-time voice interaction
4. Call status updates are tracked throughout the lifecycle


## Campaign Features

When using Twilio with campaigns:
- **Rate Limiting**: Enforced per organization to prevent overwhelming
- **Automatic Retry**: Failed calls (busy/no-answer) are retried automatically
- **Concurrent Call Management**: System manages call slots to optimize throughput

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid phone number error">
    Ensure phone numbers include country code in E.164 format: `+1234567890`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Authentication failed">
    - Verify Account SID and Auth Token are correct
    - Check for extra spaces in credentials
    - Ensure credentials haven't been regenerated in Twilio Console
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Webhook signature validation failing">
    - Confirm your Auth Token matches exactly
    - Verify the webhook URL matches what Twilio sends
    - Check if you're behind a proxy that modifies requests
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No audio on calls">
    - Verify WebSocket connection is established
    - Check firewall rules for WebSocket traffic
    - Ensure audio pipeline is configured correctly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

- Store credentials securely in the database
- Test your configuration with a single call before running campaigns
- Monitor Twilio Console for usage and billing
