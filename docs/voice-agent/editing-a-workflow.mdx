## Overview

A workflow is a graph of connected nodes representing conversation stages, with pathways defining agent movement between stages.

## Global Node

Contains instructions applicable across the entire call:
- Company context
- Overall agent goal
- Tone and personality
- Common objection handling

## Node-Level Toggles

### Add Global Prompt
- Recommended to inject Global Node instructions into most nodes

### Allow Interruption
- **Default "On"**: Bot stops and responds to user interruption
- **"Off"**: Bot continues speaking, ignoring user input

### Detect Voicemail
- Available only in Start Node
- Automatically disconnects if voicemail detected

## Variable Extraction

Supported in Agent and End Call Nodes:
- Extract structured variables
- Define name, type, and description
- Examples: customer name, budget, interest

## Webhook Node

- Executed at call end
- Sends payload to specific endpoint
- Use for:
  - Storing call data
  - Triggering automation
  - Syncing with CRMs

## Editing Workflows

- Selectively delete nodes/pathways
- Completely reset workflow

## Pathways and Tool Calls

- Define agent node movement
- Use tool calls to transition between nodes
- **"tool"** is a reserved keyword for function calls and actions
