### Template Rendering
You can reference template variables which is passed as `initial_context` either using the API Trigger or when uploading a Sheet for a campaign. You can also use any extracted variable as `gathered_context`

The template rendering can take nested values. 

Example: If the initial context is

```
{
    "initial_context": {
        "user": {
            "name": "John"
        }
    }
}
```

You can write your prompt to access the user's name as below

Prompt: `You are Alice, who is talking to {{initial_context.user.name}}.`

### Nodes
Dograh Voice Agents are composed of various nodes. These nodes can provide instructions to the voice agent, help you setup a trigger where you can trigger the voice agent to call someone, or help you setup a webhook, where you can update the results of the call in your CRM or trigger a downstream workflow in n8n. In the next steps, we will be documenting the nodes that you can use in building the voice agent.
