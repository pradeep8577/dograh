## About Dograh

**Dograh is an open-source alternative to Vapi** - Dograh helps you build voice AI agents with an easy drag-and-drop workflow builder. Unlike proprietary solutions like Vapi, Dograh gives you:

- **100% open source** - no vendor lock-in, full transparency
- **Self-hostable** - deploy anywhere, own your infrastructure  
- **Complete control** - every line of code is open and customizable
- **2-minute setup** - from zero to working voice bot in under 2 minutes

## Setting up

Get the platform up and running using Docker with a single command on your local computer. If you are looking to deploy the platform on a server, please check the [Deployment](deployment) section.

<Note>We collect anonymous usage data to improve the product. You can opt out by setting the `ENABLE_TELEMETRY` to `false` in the below command.</Note>

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dograh-hq/dograh/main/docker-compose.yaml && REGISTRY=ghcr.io/dograh-hq ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true docker compose up --pull always
```

Please check [Prerequisites](getting-started/prerequisites) for the system requirements and [Troubleshooting](getting-started/troubleshooting) for common issues.
