Deploy Dograh AI with your own custom domain name for a professional production setup.

## What is Custom Domain Deployment?

Custom domain deployment allows you to run Dograh AI with a personalized domain name (like `voice.yourcompany.com`) instead of using IP addresses. This setup includes:

- **Custom Domain**: Access your application via a memorable domain name
- **Automatic SSL**: Proper SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt or similar providers
- **Professional Setup**: Production-ready configuration for business use
- **Easy Sharing**: Share a clean URL with your team and customers

## Benefits

- **Better User Experience**: Clean, memorable URLs for your voice AI applications
- **SSL Security**: Proper HTTPS certificates that browsers trust
- **Professional Image**: Custom domains enhance your brand presence
- **Easy Management**: Simplified access and sharing across your organization

## Coming Soon

- Step-by-step domain configuration
- Automated SSL certificate setup
